# HW15: Cricket Strategies implementation Using Strategy Design Pattern
## Background
Cricket is a game of sports, very popular across the world especially in England, India and Australia. 
In this assignment, I have tried to implement basic Cricket Strategies for the various roles.

In Cricket, we have 3 roles, namely,

1. Batsman
2. Bowler
3. Fielder

Depending on the situation of a game and the format, we use different strategies for the roles.
We have implemented 2 Strategies for each role.  

Batting Strategy
1. Aggressive Batting Strategy
2. Defensive Batting Strategy

Bowling Strategy
1. Aggressive Bowling Strategy
2. Defensive Bowling Strategy

Fielding Strategy
1. Aggressive Fielding Strategy
2. Defensive Fielding Strategy
## Approach
Depending on the strategies, I have set some parameters according to my knowledge.

I initialize the strategies during run time execution as we are required by the strategy design pattern.
